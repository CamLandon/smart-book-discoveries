Book Recommendation System - Project Checklist

PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP
- Install VSCode, GitHub, and set up a virtual environment.
- Install necessary Python libraries (beautifulsoup4, requests, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
- Set up the GitHub repository and clone it locally.
- Organize the project folder structure.
```shell
Phase 1: Complete
```
  
PHASE 2: DATA COLLECTION (Web Scraping)
- Choose a data source (Goodreads, Gutenberg, Google Books API).
- Write the web scraper (scraper.py) to collect book metadata.
- Store the scraped data in CSV format.
  
PHASE 3: DATA CLEANING & PREPROCESSING
- Load and inspect the dataset using Pandas.
- Clean missing values, remove duplicates, and process text data.
- Apply text preprocessing (stopwords removal, lemmatization).
  
PHASE 4: BUILD THE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
- Implement Content-Based Filtering using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
- Compute similarity scores between books.
- Create a function to generate book recommendations.
  
PHASE 5: VISUALIZATION & ANALYSIS
- Plot book genre distribution using Matplotlib.
- Generate a Word Cloud from book descriptions.
- Evaluate recommendation accuracy using sample queries.
  
PHASE 6: DEPLOYMENT (Optional)
- Build a simple Streamlit app for interactive recommendations.
- Test the app locally using 'streamlit run app.py'.
  
PHASE 7: WRITING THE PROJECT REPORT IN OVERLEAF
- Set up Overleaf and create a new LaTeX document.
- Write sections for Introduction, Data Collection, Methodology, Results, and Conclusion.
- Include generated charts and visualizations in the report.
- Compile the report and export it as a PDF.
